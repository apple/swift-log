# Code of Conduct
To be a truly great community, SwiftLog needs to welcome developers from all walks of life,
with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly
community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great
code. We will work diligently to make the SwiftLog community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, SwiftLog has adopted the code of conduct
defined by [contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org). This document is used across many open source
communities, and we think it articulates our values well. The full text is copied below:

### Contributor Code of Conduct v1.3
As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and
welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting
issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or
nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing otherâ€™s private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and
consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project
maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed
from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an
individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by
contacting a project maintainer at [swift-log-conduct@group.apple.com](mailto:swift-log-conduct@group.apple.com). All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident.

*This policy is adapted from the Contributor Code of Conduct [version 1.3.0](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).*

### Reporting
A working group of community members is committed to promptly addressing any [reported issues](mailto:swift-server-conduct@group.apple.com).
Working group members are volunteers appointed by the project lead, with a
preference for individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives. Membership is expected
to change regularly, and may grow or shrink.
